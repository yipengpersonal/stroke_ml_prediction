# 🏥 Stroke Prediction Analysis - Comprehensive Report

## 📌 1. Introduction

### 🔹 1.1 Context
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, responsible for approximately **11% of total deaths** according to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. Predicting stroke occurrences using health and demographic factors can assist medical professionals in **early diagnosis** and **preventive care**.

### 🎯 1.2 Objective
The goal of this analysis is to build a **predictive model** that determines whether a patient is at risk of stroke based on factors like **age, medical conditions, and lifestyle choices**.

### 📊 1.3 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of patient health records with the following key features:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **`gender`**: Male, Female, or Other.
- **`age`**: Patient’s age (numerical).
- **`hypertension`**: 0 = No, 1 = Yes.
- **`heart_disease`**: 0 = No, 1 = Yes.
- **`ever_married`**: Yes/No.
- **`work_type`**: Private, Govt Job, Self-employed, Children, Never worked.
- **`Residence_type`**: Rural or Urban.
- **`avg_glucose_level`**: Average glucose level.
- **`bmi`**: Body Mass Index.
- **`smoking_status`**: Formerly smoked, Never smoked, Smokes, Unknown.
- **`stroke`** (Target variable): 1 = Stroke, 0 = No Stroke.

## 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔍 2.1 Data Inspection
- Data is loaded using **Pandas**.
- Overview using `.info()` and `.describe()`.
- Missing values checked using **`missingno`**.

### 📈 2.2 Data Visualization
- 📊 **Histograms & Boxplots**: Age, BMI, and glucose level distributions.
- 📉 **Bar Plots**: Stroke vs. No Stroke cases.
- 🔗 **Correlation Matrix**: Relationship between features.

### 🔍 2.3 Key Findings
✅ **Older individuals** have a higher stroke risk.  
✅ **Higher glucose levels & BMI** are strong predictors.  
⚠️ **Dataset is highly imbalanced** with very few stroke cases.

## 🛠️ 3. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

### 🏗️ 3.1 Handling Missing Values
- **BMI** missing values are handled using **mean imputation** (`SimpleImputer`).

### 🔤 3.2 Encoding Categorical Variables
- **One-hot encoding** applied to `gender`, `work_type`, `Residence_type`, and `smoking_status`.
- **Label encoding** used where necessary.

### 📏 3.3 Feature Scaling
- Standardized (`StandardScaler`) **age, avg_glucose_level, and BMI**.

### ⚖️ 3.4 Addressing Class Imbalance
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** used to balance `stroke=1`.

## 🤖 4. Model Training & Evaluation

### 🔄 4.1 Train-Test Split
- **80% Training / 20% Testing** using `train_test_split()`.

### 🏆 4.2 Machine Learning Models
#### ✅ **Baseline Model: Dummy Classifier**
- Used to compare performance against random predictions.

#### 📊 **Logistic Regression**
- Used for binary classification.

#### 🖥️ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Trained with **RBF kernel** for better decision boundaries.

#### 🔍 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Evaluated with different values of **K**.

### 🎭 4.3 Cross-Validation
- **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** ensures balanced training.
- **RepeatedStratifiedKFold** improves generalization.

### 📉 4.4 Performance Metric
> **Given severe class imbalance, AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) is the primary evaluation metric.**  
> It provides a balanced view of how well the model distinguishes between stroke and non-stroke cases.
